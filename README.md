## 🚀 Featured Project

📦 Automatic Box Folding Machine |
| :--- |
| > **Industrial automation solution for high-speed and precise cardboard packaging.** |
| To address manual labor inefficiencies, I designed and built this system to automate the entire folding process, integrating complex mechanical movements with real-time PLC control. |
| - 🏗️ **Mechanical Design** — Fully modeled and assembled in **SolidWorks** for structural integrity. |
| - ⚙️ **Control Logic** — Developed using **TIA Portal** for a **Siemens S7-1200 (1214C DC/DC/DC)**. |
| - 🔌 **System Integration** — Implementing seamless communication with industrial sensors and actuators. |
| - 🛡️ **Efficiency** — Focused on reducing cycle time and ensuring consistent folding quality. |
| **Built with Siemens + SolidWorks + C** |
