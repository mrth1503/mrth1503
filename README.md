## 🚀 [Graduation Project](https://github.com/mrth1503/Graduation-Project)

📦 Automatic Box Folding Machine 

This is my graduation project, a carton folding machine model designed to fold pre-cut cardboard blanks. The system automates the entire process, including blank feeding, folding, and ejecting the finished products.

What I did:

- Developed the system concept and designed the overall mechanical and control model.

- Used EPLAN to design electrical schematics and control panel drawings.

- Used AutoCAD Electrical to design the electrical cabinet layout.

- Programmed and controlled the system using PLC Siemens S7-1200.

- Designed and developed the HMI interface for system monitoring and control.
